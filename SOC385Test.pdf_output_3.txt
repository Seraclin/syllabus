4. Film Individual Project (12%, 120 points) 
Choose one or two scenes from the film and describe in detail not only what the film tries 
to say, but also how it is said. In other words, pay close attention to the relationship 
between the story elements (plot, character, etc.), the language of film (mise-en-scène, 
editing, sound, cinematography, etc.) and the society (the film talks about, as well as the 
society that creates the film). A reaction paper should not be a plot summary or a 
biography of the director, nor should it merely be your opinion of the film. Complete 
details of the requirement will be distributed in class. Due: 2/26, 10:00 pm 
 
5. TV Individual Project (12%, 120 points) 
Complete details of the requirement will be distributed in class. Due: 3/22, 10:00pm 
 
6. Internet Group Project (12%, 120 points) PPT Only 
Analysis a media company or a particular time of a media company. You need to 
pinpoint the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, as well as the 
reasons behind. Complete details of the requirement will be distributed in class.

7. Advertisement Individual Project (12%, 120 points)

announced later. Due: 4/28, 10:00pm 
 
8. Participation (20%, 200 points) 
Participation weighs heavily toward the final grade. As this is not primarily a lecture 
course, much of the learning takes place during exchange of ideas in class. You should 
pace yourself so that you come to class well prepared for discussion. Buying out is the 
only option. Other than that will lower your total grade a letter.
