Overview:  
This course introduces students to contemporary Chinese media and entertainment 
industry. Students will learn to investigate issues that arise in the interactions between 
media and society within a globalizing world by focusing on the development of Chinese 
media industry, mainland focused, since 1978. A range of Chinese media platforms will 
be discussed, including but not limited to newspapers, film, radio, TV, online media 
channels, social media, and so on. The class discussion starts with the historical and 
social context of the given media, the general developing trends, and is followed by 
analyzing specific cases. Through this course, students will gain both interpretive and 
critical methods to evaluate, and ultimately understand the dynamic relationship between 
society, media industry, culture and the media content, which is linked to a complex and 
globalized environment. In addition to class lecturing, we might invite some experts in 
the field join us with the latest information. 
**There is no language requirement or prerequisite for this course.

1. News Digest and Discussion Leadership (4%, 40 points) 
Students are required to collect and report on the latest Chinese Media news throughout 
the semester. Please bring in a recent news article about Chinese media, and then lead 
classroom discussion. For example, if you sign up for a news discussion spot in the TV 
section, you need bring in a piece of news about Chinese TV. The presenter needs to 
summarize the news, make a short comment, and prepare one or two thoughtful questions 
to guide a 3-minute class discussion. Digital sign-up sheet will be provided for choosing 
discussion days. 
 
2. Reading Reaction Papers (16%, 160 points, 16 points x 10) 
Students are required to write a 300 words reflection for each required reading. Please 
briefly describe the main ideas/statements of the paper and do not forget to add your own 
thoughts and comments. Students need to reflect on 10 articles from the total 17 readings 
(from reading #0 to reading #16).  
 
3. News Group Project (12%, 120 points) PPT Only 
This project consists of a systematic analysis of some aspect of American media coverage 
of China. By using content analysis, the group should prepare a 3 or 4-slide PowerPoint 
presentation to share the findings. All members in the same group get the exact same 
grade. Details will be announced in class. Due:  2/8, 10:00 pm

4. Film Individual Project (12%, 120 points) 
Choose one or two scenes from the film and describe in detail not only what the film tries 
to say, but also how it is said. In other words, pay close attention to the relationship 
between the story elements (plot, character, etc.), the language of film (mise-en-scène, 
editing, sound, cinematography, etc.) and the society (the film talks about, as well as the 
society that creates the film). A reaction paper should not be a plot summary or a 
biography of the director, nor should it merely be your opinion of the film. Complete 
details of the requirement will be distributed in class. Due: 2/26, 10:00 pm 
 
5. TV Individual Project (12%, 120 points) 
Complete details of the requirement will be distributed in class. Due: 3/22, 10:00pm 
 
6. Internet Group Project (12%, 120 points) PPT Only 
Analysis a media company or a particular time of a media company. You need to 
pinpoint the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, as well as the 
reasons behind. Complete details of the requirement will be distributed in class.  
Due: 4/10, 10:00pm 
 
7. Advertisement Individual Project (12%, 120 points) 
One page only. Study how the U.S. and China advertise same products. Details will be 
announced later. Due: 4/28, 10:00pm 
 
8. Participation (20%, 200 points) 
Participation weighs heavily toward the final grade. As this is not primarily a lecture 
course, much of the learning takes place during exchange of ideas in class. You should 
pace yourself so that you come to class well prepared for discussion. Buying out is the 
only option. Other than that will lower your total grade a letter. 
 
Office hours and E-mail:

weekdays and 48 hours on weekend to hear back from me via email. 
 
Plagiarism:  
All assignments turned in for this course must be the student’s own work or must be 
properly attributed to the source with proper citations. Students are to do their own work,

Access and Disability Resources:  
Students with medical/health conditions that might impact academic success should visit 
Access, Disability Services and Resources (ADSR formerly the Office of Disability 
Services, ODS) to determine eligibility for appropriate accommodations. Students who 
receive accommodations must present the Accommodation Letter from ADSR to your 
professor at the beginning of the semester, or when the letter is received.    
 
Writing Center and ESL Program Support for Emory College Students: 
Tutors in the Emory Writing Center and the ESL Program are available to support Emory 
College students as they work on any type of writing assignment, at any stage of the 
composing process. Tutors can assist with a range of projects, from traditional papers and 
presentations to websites and other multimedia projects. Writing Center and ESL tutors 
take a similar approach as they work with students on concerns including idea 
development, structure, use of sources, grammar, and word choice. They do not 
proofread for students. Instead, they discuss strategies and resources students can use as 
they write, revise, and edit their own work. Students who are non-native speakers of 
English are welcome to visit either the Writing Center tutors or the ESL tutors. All other 
students in the college should see Writing Center tutors. Learn more and make an 
appointment by visiting the websites of the ESL Program and the Writing Center. Please 
review tutoring policies before your visit.
