Access and Disability Resources:  
Students with medical/health conditions that might impact academic success should visit 
Access, Disability Services and Resources (ADSR formerly the Office of Disability 
Services, ODS) to determine eligibility for appropriate accommodations. Students who 
receive accommodations must present the Accommodation Letter from ADSR to your 
professor at the beginning of the semester, or when the letter is received.    
 
Writing Center and ESL Program Support for Emory College Students: 
Tutors in the Emory Writing Center and the ESL Program are available to support Emory 
College students as they work on any type of writing assignment, at any stage of the 
composing process. Tutors can assist with a range of projects, from traditional papers and 
presentations to websites and other multimedia projects. Writing Center and ESL tutors 
take a similar approach as they work with students on concerns including idea 
development, structure, use of sources, grammar, and word choice. They do not 
proofread for students. Instead, they discuss strategies and resources students can use as 
they write, revise, and edit their own work. Students who are non-native speakers of 
English are welcome to visit either the Writing Center tutors or the ESL tutors. All other 
students in the college should see Writing Center tutors. Learn more and make an 
appointment by visiting the websites of the ESL Program and the Writing Center. Please 
review tutoring policies before your visit.
