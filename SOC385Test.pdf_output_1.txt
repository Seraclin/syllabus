Overview:  
This course introduces students to contemporary Chinese media and entertainment 
industry. Students will learn to investigate issues that arise in the interactions between 
media and society within a globalizing world by focusing on the development of Chinese 
media industry, mainland focused, since 1978. A range of Chinese media platforms will 
be discussed, including but not limited to newspapers, film, radio, TV, online media 
channels, social media, and so on. The class discussion starts with the historical and 
social context of the given media, the general developing trends, and is followed by 
analyzing specific cases. Through this course, students will gain both interpretive and 
critical methods to evaluate, and ultimately understand the dynamic relationship between 
society, media industry, culture and the media content, which is linked to a complex and 
globalized environment. In addition to class lecturing, we might invite some experts in 
the field join us with the latest information. 
**There is no language requirement or prerequisite for this course.
